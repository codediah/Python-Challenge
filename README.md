# Python-Challenge

I remembered my instructor mentioning the zip function, but I used Google to figure out exactly what syntax to use  to turn the csv files into separate lists to easily work with.

Googled the syntax for the index function as well to get the dateMax value.

Used ChatGPT to help clean up syntax and logic on two loops in the PyPoll. In the uniqueCand, it just showed me I thought of it backwards and was doing i+1 instead of i-1 so I was going out of the range which I somehow couldn't piece together even though the error I was getting kept saying "out of range" so it wasn't even necessary if I hadn't been so caught up in trying to make i+1 work somehow.

The second loop it helped on was building the votes list. I was referring to i twice instead of coming up with a second variable, which ended up as index. So the only code I took from it was the index= line. The structure of both loops was mine from the start, I only use it to correct syntax I can't figure out on my own.
